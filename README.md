# Clustering and Classification Credit Risk Assessment: Individual Methods and Hybrid Approaches

This repository contains the code developed for my MSc Financial and Computational Mathematics dissertation using German and Australian credit datasets. It covers EDA, preprocessing, clustering, classification, and hybrid models.

**University:** University of Nottingham, School of Mathematics

## Project Overview
This project analyses German and Australian credit datasets to assess credit risk. It covers exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing (skew reduction, scaling, encoding), K-Means clustering with UMAP/t-SNE visualization, and classification using Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Cluster features are also incorporated to improve classification performance, with hyperparameter tuning applied for optimal results.

Data files:
- `german.data`
- `australian.dat`

Code File:
- `CreditRiskAssessment.py`

Please make sure all data files are in the same folder as the code file when running it.

## Requirements
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `umap-learn`
